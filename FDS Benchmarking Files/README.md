# FDS Benchmarking

Benchmarking FDS on different computer systems is an important step in seeing
how a computer setup is likely to compare to others in terms of running a model.

This following files allow this to be done. Distributed with FDS 5 (and for some
reason stopped in FDS 6), the following files allow you to run a comparison
between systems and compare how they perform.

There are two different FDS. Below is the process to running them both
individually to provide results for the benchmarking table here. 


*Note these are simplistic models, designed solely to get a comparison between
different CPU's and different operating systems. Note that many other factors
may affect the performance of a system and **therefore this should only be used
as a guide** .* I take no responsibility for purchasing decisions based on these
results - they are purely "an estimate" of the speed you're likely to see.
