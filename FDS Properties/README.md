# FDS Properties

As NIST stopped including properties in FDS 5, this section aims to construct a
database of properties (with references from where they were taken) for
inclusion within FDS models.

The output file is a file created in [Pyrosim](www.thunderheadeng.com/pyrosim/).
If you're a Pyrosim user, you can download the FDS file and use it as a library
file to import the materials into your own FDS files. This can be done by adding
the libary from within the materials/surface section and selecting the
downloaded FDS file.

As an FDS user, you can just copy and paste the values into your FDS file.
